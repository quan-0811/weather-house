Module 1: Cassandra Intro and Background

1. Compares to relational Database
    Application >>> Model >>> Data
    Queries are king
    Primary keys are more than just for uniqueness
    Distributed Architecture
    Availability & Partition Tolerence (in CAP theorem) instead of ACID
    Denormalization instead or joinds and indexes
    Referential Integrity not enforced 

2. Terminology
    data model
    keyspace: container of table
    table: rows x columns
    partition:
        data is stored based on partition
    primary key: partition key
        uniqueness
        placement of the record in the cluster -> accessibility

3. CQL Fundementals
    Building Blocks: Keyspaces, Tables, Primary Keyspaces
    CQL Commands: SELECT, TRUNCATE, ALTER TABLE, SOURCE

4. Partitions
    Partition Keys
    Composite Partition Keys
    Clustering Columns
    

Module 2: Cassandra Building Blocks

1. Denormalization
    Construct and store the <Result of Join command> in denomalized table.
    No Join will be used later.

2. Collections, User Defined Types, and Counters
    Collection: Set, List, Map (like python Dictionary)
        Groups and stores data together in a single columns
        Collection columns are multi-valued columns
        Designed to store a small amount of data
        Retrieved in its entirety
        Cannot be part of primary key, partition key or clustering column
        Cannot nest a collection inside of another collection
            Unless you use FROZEN keyword


    User Defined Types (UDT)
        A list of component types.
        For example: CREATE TYPE full name ( first name text, last name text);

    Counters
        A dedicated type to use instead of COUNT ON in SQL
