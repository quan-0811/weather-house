Module 1: Cassandra Intro and Background

1. Compares to relational Database
    Application >>> Model >>> Data
    Queries are king
    Primary keys are more than just for uniqueness
    Distributed Architecture
    Availability & Partition Tolerence (in CAP theorem) instead of ACID
    Denormalization instead or joinds and indexes
    Referential Integrity not enforced 

2. Terminology
    data model
    keyspace: container of table
    table: rows x columns
    partition:
        data is stored based on partition
    primary key: partition key
        uniqueness
        placement of the record in the cluster -> accessibility

3. CQL Fundementals
    Building Blocks: Keyspaces, Tables, Primary Keyspaces
    CQL Commands: SELECT, TRUNCATE, ALTER TABLE, SOURCE

4. Partitions
